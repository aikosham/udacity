# Data Science Nanodegree

This repo contains the files for the Data Science nanodegree, project 1. The goal is to write a datascience blog post for a non-technical audience.

I chose the [Titanic dataset available from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv).

- [`1-blog`](./1-blog) contains the files for the data science blog post

## Pre-requisites
`requirements.txt` contains the exact virtualenv and versions that were used to develop all the files for this nanodegree.

However, for this project, only the following libraries were utilized:

```
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
```

## Repo layout

The repo contains the following files under the `1-blog` folder.
```
.
├── README.md
├── titanic.ipynb
└── train.csv
```

`README.md` is this file, `titanic.ipynb` is the python notebook and `train.csv` contains the dataset from Titanic.

## Blog Post
The blog post that uses the files is located on Medium: https://aikosham.medium.com/surviving-the-titanic-3f996bf4b8de

## Acknowledgements
I took help from multiple blogs on medium that did orthogonal analysis of the same dataset that I was using.
